# HBDHelper

HBDHelper is a smart contract-based solution to help you remember and prepare for upcoming birthdays. Built using Move language, the system uses a decentralized approach to ensure that you always have a gift ready for your loved ones.

The system works by allowing you to create and claim offers for gifts using smart contracts. You can set reminders for upcoming birthdays and create offers for gifts that you would like to give to someone on a specific date. These offers are then stored on the blockchain and made available to other users.

When the birthday arrives, the system automatically checks for any outstanding offers for that date and notifies you of the available gifts. You can claim the gift by accepting the offer, which triggers the smart contract to transfer the gift from the sender's wallet to your wallet. The system ensures that only one claim can be made per offer and that gifts cannot be duplicated or tampered with.

With HBDHelper, you can avoid the embarrassment of forgetting birthdays or showing up empty-handed to a birthday party. The system is open-source and can be customized and extended to support different types of gifts and occasions.
